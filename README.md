# Pet-Adoption-Dashboard

## Description

For our team's project, we wanted to build a pet adoption application that allows users to search to navigate a map to find local animal shelters, which will also then provide them with available pets to adopt. The motivation to build this application was our team's love for animals and the desire to help them find a loving home. This application operates as a central location for individuals to see the animal shelters in their area to better plan their travels and get directions to nearby shelters. With the high number of animals in shelters, we hope that this application will increase the visibility of these animals leading to higher adoption rates. Through this project, we were able to strengthen our skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and APIs. It created a great learning experience building an application from scratch that looks good and has functionality.

To use this Pet Adoption Dashboard, please click on this link, https://thanhmhoang.github.io/pet-adoption-map/. Once users reach the webpage, users will be presented with a search bar to the left of the webpage where users can input a city of their choosing, once they select a location that appears, the will jump to that location enabling users to find local shelters in that area. Users will then seleect a animal specie and gender in the drop down menus. Once they hit the "Search" button, users will be led to the next page. They will be presented with animals that meet their search criteria, which will include images and short descriptions about them. If users would like to return to the home page to view the map, they can simply click the "Home" button at the top center. Once the user knows what animal they want and where they're location, next step is bringing that animal home!
