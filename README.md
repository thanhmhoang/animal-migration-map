# animal-migration-map

## Description

For our team's project, we wanted to build a pet adoption application that allows users to search for shelters in their desired city, which will also then provide them with available pets to adopt. The motivation to build this application was our team's love for animals and the desire to help them find a loving home. This application operates as a central location for individuals to see the animal shelters in their area to better plan their travels and get directions to nearby shelters. With the high number of animals in shelters, we hope that this application will increase the visibility of these animals leading to higher adoption rates. Through this project, we were able to strengthen our skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and APIs. It created a great learning experience building an application from scratch that looks good and has functionality.

## Usage

To use this Pet Adoption Dashboard, please click on this link, https://thanhmhoang.github.io/pet-adoption-map/. Once users reach the webpage, users will be presented with a search bar to the left of the webpage where users can input a city of their choosing to find local shelters in that area. Once they hit the "Search" button, shelters within the city they search by will appear on the map to the right. Users will be able to interact with the map to see where the closest shelter to them is and use it to estimate and plan their travel. When a user is ready to look at the available pets, users will then click the "Ready to Adopt" button which will lead them to the next page. Once users are hit the "Ready to Adopt" button, they will be presented with a variety of animals which will include images and short descriptions about them. Users can then input the specific animal specie they are looking for in the search bar and click the "Search" button. Then the available animals results will be filtered based off of their search criteria. If users would like to return to the home page to view the map, they can simply click the "Home" button at the top right. Once the user knows what animal they want and where they're location, next step is bringing that animal home!
